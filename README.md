# Satellite-Database-Management-System
This Application handles basic operations of a Space company and help them to keep a database of their satellites. Operations such as adding, deleting, updating can be performed 
in this application. We have used Microsoft SQL Server and IntelliJ IDE to build and test this application. We used JavaFx instead of traditional Java as JavaFx can be embedded
with CSS thus giving better UI and also supports MVC architecture which helps in better management of code.
